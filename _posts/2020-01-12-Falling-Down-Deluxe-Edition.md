title: Falling Down Deluxe Edition
---

This has got to be in the top films of all time, definitely worth a space in your film collection and worth every penny.

Michael Douglas kicks ass in this thriller as a downsized engineer who switches to demolition mode after he snaps from what life throws at him.

You can’t argue this has got to be one of his finest performances, it isn’t an emotional roller coaster but it keeps the testosterone pumping as you are right with Douglas and want him to blow everyone away because you know how pissed you can get. Waiting in traffic, fired from your job, getting robbed it is what led the creators of GTA to make a game about it, for that release.

Its films like this that make him stand apart not that Sentinel crap.

Get this if you claim to know about movies.

Michael Douglas and Joel Schumacherâs audio commentary, a Deconstructing D-Fens: A Conversation with Michael Douglas featurette, and theatrical trailer.
