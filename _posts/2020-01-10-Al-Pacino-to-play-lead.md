title: Al Pacino to play lead in Kevorkian biopic
---

With the trio of HBO, Barry Levinson and Al Pacino probably coming together for their latest biopic “You don’t know Jack”, it will be a treat for film connesuiers to watch Al Pacino don the role of Jack Kevorkian, infamous as a suicide assistant to more than 150 terminally ill patients during the 60’s. Dr. Jack Kevorkian himself had called upon his conviction of second-degree maximum imprisonment, when he on his own accord sent a tape of him euthanizing a terminally ill patient.

If negotiations for the biopic successfully fall through, then it will trace the graph of Dr.Jack’s life from his first assisted suicide to his legal encounters confirming the patient’s right to die along with media hype that followed.

It was rumored that Ben Kingsley was supposedly to play the lead character in this biopic, but looks like reel-life role of Dr. Kevorkian is finally going to be staged by Al Pacino.

Barry Levinson is all set to direct the film jotted by Adam Mazer of the “Breach” fame which is loosely adapted from the book “Between the Dying and the Dead: Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the Assisted Suicide Machine and the Battle to Legalize Euthanasia” written by Neal Nicol.
