title: Comical medicine recommended by Reese Witherspoon
---

Universal studios and Reese Witherspoon are setting up a new pharmaceutical business through their latest production “The Pharma Girl”. The film showcases the core working of the pharma industry that Reese’s character is working for. As she climbs the executive ladder, things start unraveling in front her and how she deals with it forms the crux of the story.

Pharmaceutical industries have mostly been depicted in a negative way especially in films like “The Fugitive” and “The Constant Gardener” which turned out to be controversial. But the film is being produced/directed as a comedy with Reese herself producing it via her Type A banner. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa of “Bad Santa” fame are writing the script while Tracy Falco and Maradith Frenkel are overlooking the project for Universal. Reese who has a won an Oscar previously for a more intense film “Walk the Line” is known more for her comedies like “Election” and “Legally Blonde”. Even presently she is focusing on acting in comedy flicks like Vince Vaughn starrer “Four Christmases” and signing on Columbia’s new production.
