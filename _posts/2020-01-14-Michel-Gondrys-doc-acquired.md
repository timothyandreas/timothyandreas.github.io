Michel Gondry’s documentary, “The Thorn in the Heart,” which looks at Gondry’s family and was premiered last week at the Cannes Film Festival, has been acquired by Adam Yauch’s Oscilloscope Laboratories.

The film is titled as “L’Epine dans le Coeur” in French which is produced and financed by Partizan films.

It has been reported that the film is bound to release with a DVD via digital platforms, is all set in rural France, where the relationship between the aunt, Suzette Gondry and her son Jean-Yves has been beautifully shot by passionate director Michel with innovation and creativity.

Beastie Boy Adam Yauch, Oscilloscope’s co-founder, jovially described it as: “a sincere doc on a subject that is so close to (Gondry’s) heart.”

Besides this, Gondry has recently directed “Be Kind Rewind” and now  is all set for another project titled “The Green Hornet” which is a Columbian venture.

CAA represented Gondry and production company Partizan, in the sale, while David Fenkel negotiated the deal for Oscilloscope.
