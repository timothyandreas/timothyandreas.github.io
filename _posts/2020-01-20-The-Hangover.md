title: The Hangover
---

Wild bachelor parties are like loopholes in marriage contracts and supposedly well kept closet secrets with heading title ‘I Still Know What you did last Summer’. But ‘The Hangover‘ kind of movies still gives you the vodka kind of effect where tall glasses of lemonades don’t easily bring you to normality.

I would rate ‘The Hangover’ 4 stars out of 5 because a detective story melts effortlessly into the main plot of a gawky four friends going wild and wilder in Las Vegas. A one sentence description of the plot might sound typically boring that there are three groomsmen attending their best friend’s marriage in Las Vegas. But when Jon Lucas, Scott Moore and Todd Philips come into the picture it’s a tornado of comedy with an effective dash of drama.

Phil, Stu and Alan; all served unofficial death sentences by their professions or nagging girlfriends arrive in Las Vegas to enjoy the booze, cooze up a little and the next day serve as the well behaved boys with tuxedos and gelled hair. But an apocalyptic event lands them with a narcotic memory, growling tiger in the washroom and an eternally crying baby. The groom is missing, the villa they were living in has been wrecked up and Stu has married a stripper named Jade. Whose going where, what’s happening when and when all this going to finish, leads to a fantastic chip in of comedy clips and on the line acting from Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Galifianakis. Now I don’t expect anyone to fall from their chair rolling with laughter, but a smirk isn’t expected either. The characterization of Phil, Stu and Alan hasn’t gone as bizarre as the script itself. Todd and the writers tied a strong noose around the actors so that it doesn’t result into a war between the script and the cast.

Well the humor is not a PG-13 kind, but contains raucous and unapologetic scenes which you wanna enjoy; either openly or on the sly. If you are well accepting of the humor and want to watch a good movie of the fortnight, then ‘The Hangover’ will turn out to be an excellent proposition.
